    # Old Furniture
    ###By: *Thomas Hardy*
    
    I know *not* how it may be with others
     Who sit amid relics of **householdry**
    That date from the days of their mothers' mothers,
     But well I know how it is with me
     Continually.

    I see the hands of the generations
     That owned each shiny familiar thing
    In play on its knobs and indentations,
     And with its ancient fashioning
     _Still dallying:_

    Hands behind hands, growing paler and paler,
     As in a mirror a candle-flame
    Shows images of itself, each frailer
     As it recedes, though the eye may frame
     Its shape the same.

    On the clock's dull dial a foggy finger,
     Moving to set the minutes right
    With tentative touches that lift and linger
     In the wont of a moth on a summer night,
     Creeps to my sight.

    On this old viol, too, fingers are dancing -
     As whilom - just over the strings by the nut,
    The tip of a bow receding, advancing
     In airy quivers, as if it would cut
     The plaintive gut.

    And I see a face by that box for tinder,
     Glowing forth in fits from the dark,
    And fading again, as the linten cinder
     Kindles to red at the flinty spark,
     Or goes out stark.

    Well, well. It is best to be up and doing,
     The world has no use for one to-day
    Who eyes things thus - no aim pursuing!
     He should not continue in this stay,
     But sink away.
